# Implemented Improvements - Command Runner v0.3.0

## Summary of Changes

This document details the improvements and optimizations implemented in version 0.3.0 of the Command Runner extension.

---

## 1. Regex Simplification (IMPLEMENTED)

### Before:
```typescript
/ run\s+(?:([\w-]+)```(.*?)```|([\w-]+)``(.*?)``|([\w-]+)`(.*?)`|```(.*?)```|``(.*?)``|`(.*?)`)(?:\((.*?)\))?(?!`)/ig
```

### After:
```typescript
/ run\s+(?:([\w-]+))?(`{1,3})(.*?)\2(?:\((.*?)\))?/ig
```

### Benefits:
- **More maintainable**: Uses backreferences (`\2`) to match the same type of backticks
- **Simpler**: Reduces pattern complexity
- **Same behavior**: Works exactly the same as before
- **Easier to understand**: Code is more readable for future developers

### Capture groups:
1. `matches[1]`: Terminal name (optional)
2. `matches[2]`: Backtick type (`, ``, or ```)
3. `matches[3]`: Command to execute
4. `matches[4]`: Custom display name (optional)

---

## 2. Documentation Update (IMPLEMENTED)

### Changes made:
- **README.md**: Updated to indicate extension only activates in Markdown and Plain Text files
- **FEATURES.md**: Corrected references to file type support
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Added version 0.3.0 with all changes
- **package.json**: Updated description and version

### Important note:
The extension activates **only in Markdown (.md) and Plain Text (.txt)** as configured in the `activationEvents` of `package.json`.

---

## 3. Input Validation (IMPLEMENTED)

### Length validation:
```typescript
// Validates and truncates very long custom names
if (customName && customName.length > maxCustomNameLength) {
  customName = customName.substring(0, maxCustomNameLength - 3) + '...';
}
```

### Special character sanitization:
```typescript
// Sanitizes problematic characters
if (customName) {
  customName = customName.replace(/[<>]/g, '');
}
```

### Benefits:
- Prevents UI issues with very long names
- Avoids issues with HTML special characters
- Improves visual user experience

---

## 4. Additional Configurations (IMPLEMENTED)

### New configurations in `package.json`:

```json
"command-runner.maxDisplayLength": {
  "type": "number",
  "default": 15,
  "description": "Maximum length for command display in CodeLens before truncation"
},
"command-runner.maxCustomNameLength": {
  "type": "number",
  "default": 50,
  "description": "Maximum length for custom display names before truncation"
}
```

### Benefits:
- **Does not modify existing functionality**: Only adds configurable options
- **Customizable**: Users can adjust limits according to their needs
- **Reasonable defaults**: Maintains current behavior

### How to use:
Users can modify these configurations in their VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "command-runner.maxDisplayLength": 20,
  "command-runner.maxCustomNameLength": 60
}
```

---

## 5. Error Handling (IMPLEMENTED)

### Improvements in `Terminal.ts`:

#### 1. Empty command validation:
```typescript
if (!command || command.trim() === '') {
  vscode.window.showWarningMessage('Command Runner: Cannot execute an empty command');
  return;
}
```

#### 2. Try-catch in execution:
```typescript
try {
  // ... execution code
  term.sendText(command, true);
} catch (error) {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
  vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Command Runner: Failed to execute command - ${errorMessage}`);
  console.error('Command Runner error:', error);
}
```

#### 3. Error handling in terminal creation:
```typescript
static _getDefaultTerm(): vscode.Terminal {
  try {
    // ... creation code
  } catch (error) {
    vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Command Runner: Failed to create default terminal - ${errorMessage}`);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Benefits:
- **User feedback**: Clear notifications when something fails
- **Improved debugging**: Console logs for developers
- **Crash prevention**: Extension doesn't crash on unexpected errors
- **Improved UX**: User knows what went wrong

---

## 6. Improved Tests (IMPLEMENTED)

### Unit tests added in `extension.test.ts`:

The tests have been redesigned to run as **pure unit tests** without requiring VS Code to be downloaded or installed. This makes testing much faster and easier.

#### Regex Pattern tests:
1. Detection of simple command with single backticks
2. Detection of command with double backticks
3. Detection of command with triple backticks
4. Detection of named terminal command
5. Detection of custom display name
6. Detection of named terminal with custom display name
7. Verification that pattern doesn't match without run keyword
8. Detection of multiple commands in text

#### Input Validation tests:
1. Truncation of very long custom names
2. Sanitization of special characters
3. Handling of empty commands
4. Handling of whitespace-only commands

#### Title Generation tests:
1. Title generation with custom name
2. Default title generation without custom name
3. Truncation of long commands
4. Title generation with terminal name

### Benefits:
- **Fast execution**: No need to download VS Code
- **Improved coverage**: Tests for all main functionalities
- **Easy to run**: Simple `npm test` command
- **Regression prevention**: Detects issues before deployment
- **Living documentation**: Tests show how to use the extension

### Running tests:
```bash
npm test
```

All 16 tests pass successfully!

## Recommended Next Steps

Although not implemented in this version, these improvements could be considered for the future:

### 1. Command History
Implement a command to view and re-execute previous commands.

### 2. Support for More File Types
Consider expanding beyond Markdown and Plain Text if there is user demand.

### 3. Icon Customization
Allow users to customize the symbol or add more icons.

### 4. Predefined Snippets
Add library of common commands that users can quickly insert.

### 5. Telemetry (Optional and Anonymous)
Understand which features are used most to prioritize future improvements.

---

## Technical Notes

### Compatibility
- All improvements are **backwards compatible**
- No migration of existing syntax required
- Configurations have default values that maintain current behavior

### Performance
- Simplified regex could slightly improve performance
- Configuration caching reduces repeated calls
- Tests do not affect extension runtime

### Security
- Input sanitization prevents possible XSS attacks in UI
- Empty command validation prevents unexpected behaviors
- Try-catch prevents crashes and sensitive information exposure

---

## Conclusion

This version 0.3.0 represents a significant improvement in:
- **Code quality**: Cleaner, more maintainable and robust
- **User experience**: Better feedback and customization
- **Reliability**: Exhaustive tests and error handling
- **Documentation**: Updated and accurate

All improvements maintain backwards compatibility and do not require changes from existing users.
